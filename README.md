
### Localization utilities

This presents a set of utilities for handling multilanguage and translations for web applications. It adds Gettext support to the web application and configures Gettext with settings defined in the application configuration file. It also supports document translations and full HTML page translations.

The localization utilities contains an utility to prepare and launch xgettext via Makefile and provides integration with the twig framework, via a twig filter and a utility for parsing twig templates into a format that is understandable by xgettext.

## Installation

You can install this collection in your project using composer:
```
composer require fccn/webapp-tools/translate

```

To complete the installation copy the contents of the **locale** and **utils** folder into **[project_root]/locale** and **[project_root]/utils** respectively. These folders contain the utilities for preparing and launching xgettext and parsing the twig files.

### Locale folder

The Makefile inside the locale folder prepares the content to be processed by xgettex and calls xgettext to builds the .po and .mo files. It is configured to work inside the **locale** directory, looks for php code on **[project_root]/app** folder and the parsed twig templates on **[project_root]/cache**.

The header.po file is the base file for generating the individual .po files for each language. This file must be locate in the root of the **locale** folder.

The locale folder also holds the translation files. Each language must have its own content folder. The folder must be named with the country ID (i.e pt_PT). Inside each language folder there must be following structure:

- **[country ID]/**
 - **files/** - location for document translations
 - **html/** - location for full HTML page translations
 - **LC_MESSAGES/** - location for Gettex translations

The locale folder already contains pre built language folders for pt_PT and en_EN languages.

### Utils folder

When using the Twig integration, there will be a point where it is necessary to extract the template strings. Unfortunately, the xgettext utility does not understand Twig templates natively. For that reason the script in **[project_root]/utils/make_php_cache_files.php** converts Twig templates to PHP files, so that xgettext can be called on the template cache instead. The script requires Twig to be configured in the same way as is it used on the application. You can add the required Twig extensions and filters in the **[project_root]/utils/TwigConfigLoader.php** file.

## Configuration

The localization utilities were designed with the FCCN's webapp skeleton project in mind. For this reason the script to build the .po and .mo files will search for the web application code in **[project_root]/app** folder. If your application's code is stored on another folder you need to edit the **[project_root]/locale/Makefile** before using the Gettext utilities.

The following key-value pairs need to be added to the application configuration file *$c* array:
```php
$c = array(
    ...
    #----- locale configuration
    "defaultLocale"      => "pt_PT",          # Setup the default locale
    "defaultLocaleLabel" => "PT",             # and default locale label

    #- array of available locales
    "locales"            => array(
                              array("label" => "GB", "locale" => "en_GB", "flag_alt" => "English flag", "language" => "English"),
                              array("label" => "PT", "locale" => "pt_PT", "flag_alt" => "Portuguese flag", "language" => "PortuguÃªs"),
                              # add other languages here....
                              ),

    "locale_textdomain"  => "messages",
    "locale_path"        => "../locale", #path of the locale folder
    "locale_cookie_name" => "locale",    #name of the cookie to store locale information

    #-twig parser configurations
    "twig_parser_templates_path" => "../templates",   #path for twig templates folder
    "twig_parser_cache_path" => "../cache",            #path for cache folder
    ...
  )
```

To configure with twig, add the twig extensions and filters used in the web application to the twig parser. This prevents missinterpretations when parsing the twig templates. To do that edit **[project_root]/utils/TwigConfigLoader.php** and add the filters and extensions to the *loadConfigs* function:
```php
  public function loadConfigs($twig){
    ....

    #add the i18n extensions
    $twig->addExtension(new Twig_Extensions_some_extension());

    #add translate filter
    $filter = new Twig_SimpleFilter("my filter", function($stdClassObject) {
        return null;
    }),
    $twig->addFilter($filter);

    ...
  }
```
You can also call preset configuration loaders like the one defined in **src/TranslateConfigurationLoader.php**. The *loadConfigs()* function in **[project_root]/utils/TwigConfigLoader.php** already loads the following set of filters and extensions for localization utilities:
- Twig_Extensions_Extension_I18n - Twig internationalization extension
- Twig_Extensions_Extension_Intl - Twig date and time localization extension
- Translate filter

The localization utilities can be included into a Slim middleware, like in the example below.
```php

$app = new \Slim\App();

$app->add(function ($request, $response, $next) {
  $locale = new \Fccn\Lib\Locale();
  $locale->init();
	$response = $next($request, $response);
	return $response;
});

```

### Add more languages

To create additional languages do as follows inside the **locale** folder:

1. Add a new directory with country ID. ``mkdir -p es_ES/LC_MESSAGES``
1. Copy the header file to the directory. ``cp header.po es_ES/LC_MESSAGES/messages.po``
1. Create the directories to hold the rest of the files to translate. ``mkdir es_ES/files; mkdir es_ES/html``
1. Clean cache. ``make clean``
1. Update message files. ``make``
1. Edit the po file and translate it. ``vi es_ES/LC_MESSAGES/messages.po``
 1. Do not forget to assign language, i.e. **"Language: es_ES\n"**
1. Update message files. **make**
1. Edit the application configuration file, add the new language to the *locales* array.

## Usage

The following shows the different use cases for the language utilities.

### Translate HTML content

Put the translated HTML snippets on **locale/[country_id]/html/** folder. The snippets must have the same name on all language folders. To obtain the translated HTML content from a snippet on file named *my_snippet.html* do as follows:
```php

  $locale = new \Fccn\Lib\Locale();
  $html_content = $locale->getHtmlContent('my_snippet');

```

### Translate text content

Put the translated snippets on **locale/[country_id]/files/** folder. The snippets must have the same name on all language folders. To obtain the translated content from a snippet on file named *my_snippet.txt* do as follows:
```php

  $locale = new \Fccn\Lib\Locale();
  $html_content = $locale->getFileContent('my_snippet');

```

It is possible to include variables in the translated text snippets. The variables are represented inside brackets {} (i.e, {name}). For example if you want the snippet to adapt to the user's name you can define en_EN version of the snippet in **locale/en_EN/files/hello_user.txt**:
```
Hello {user_name}.

```
To get the content with the instantiated variable:
```php

  $locale = new \Fccn\Lib\Locale();
  $html_content = $locale->processFile('hello_user',array("{user_name}" => "New User"));

```

### Gettext translations

To add translatable content on the application code write the content you want to translate inside *_()* (i.e *_('Translate me')*).

To add translatable content on twig templates load the provided translation filters to twig:
```php
 $twig = new Twig_Environment();
 \Fccn\Lib\TranslateConfigurationLoader::loadTwigConfigs($twig);

```

Then on the twig templates just use the *trans* tag:
```
  <p>{% trans "Translatable content" %}</p>

```
Each time you add content to the application and templates you need to update the translations:
1. go to the **locale** directory and run ``make``.
1. This will update with new content the .po file on each of LC_MESSAGES folder inside the individual language directory.
1. Edit the .po files for each language and add the missing translations.
1. run ``make`` again on the **locale** folder to update the compiled translations in the .mo files.

To refresh the translated contents run ``make clean && make`` on the **locale** folder.
